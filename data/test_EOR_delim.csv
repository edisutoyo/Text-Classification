infill drilling continued after 1985 as the field experienced increasing watercut.,high water cut
the application of cwi under the carbonation level of 50 in secondary and tertiary recovery modes also recovered additional oil compared with water injection process.,high recovery

significant water production was observed for 2 years.,high water cut
the secondary process recovered more oil than the tertiary process.,high recovery
"this resulted in an excellent sweep due to the high reservoir permeabilities of the main zone reservoirs, the favorable mobility ratio and the structural dips ranging from 5 to 12 .",high recovery
"through laboratory flooding experiments, holm22 noted that higher oil recovery was obtained when the co2 slug was followed with carbonated water rather than plain water.",high recovery

"however, the dedicated research so far focuses heavily on conventional reservoirs.",others
the field is still producing a huge amount of water although water injection has been stopped.,high water cut
water cut has been significantly decreasing since co2 injection was implemented.,low water cut
today a total number of 383 wells have been drilled in the field with an average well spacing coming down to 300 m. the first tertiary recovery project was introduced in the handil field in november 1995 with the start of lean gas injection in 5 large handil reservoirs with recovery factors above 55 .,high recovery
"currently, the oil recovery is around 50 with a 15,000 bopd production at high watercut.",high water cut
"however, for css of super-heavy oil reservoirs, the cyclic time is short and the oil rate decline is high.",low production
the altered water injection has halted the production decline with no capital spending.,maintain/increase production
"aftera manuscript is technically edited and formatted, it will be removed from the fijust acceptedfl website and published as an asap article.",others
the annual oil production increased to the highest of 6.5 million barrels in 2002.,maintain/increase production
recovery factor on this reservoir by waterflooding was 26 but all reservoir wells were already watered out.,poor recovery
"8 .at the end of the third year under gas injection,there were 10 wells that had clearly improved their performance insuch a way, such as higher oil rate.",maintain/increase production
"figure 6 typical well response eor well after the start of the gas injection, a rapid response in production behavior of the eor reservoirs has been observed and the rate of decline was significantly improved.",maintain/increase production
 1 css enters into later stage with low oil production.,low production
this results in an important production loss.,low production
"however, the field production continued to decline from 200,000 bopd in the late seventies to 12,500 bopd in 2003.",low production
a recovery-factor increase of 1.2 ooip.,high recovery
the secondary cwi experiment 5 recovered 15.7 more oil than the plain wi experiment 4 while 6.4 ooip incremental oil was produced from the tertiary cwi experiment 6 .,high recovery
"they are postedonline prior to technical editing, formatting for publication and author proofing.",others
water production was no longer an issue since gas injection started.,low water cut
"to date, after 3 years of gas injection, the recovery factorfor these five reservoirs has increased by 1.2 of the oil initiallyin place, and the project is considered both a technical and aneconomic success.the predominant drive mechanism with lean-gas injection hasbeen confirmed by field data.",high recovery
"at the end of this first 5-month period, the production levelincreased to 3,700 bopd, thanks to a better performance of thewells in the first row.",maintain/increase production
acs cannot be held responsible for errors orconsequences arising from the use of information contained in these fijust acceptedfl manuscripts.,others
"then, oil swelling factor can be calculated, which would verify the existence of moving interface between cw and live crude oil.",others
"thanks to water injection, pressure has been constantly observed around 3000 psi.",maintain pressure

"the first 3 years of its application in the handil field have provedthat it can yield additional reserves from reservoirs that are stilleconomical, but otherwise at near abandonment.",high recovery
"the performance of cwi was encouraging, additional oil recovery and enhanced injectivity were obtained.",high recovery
"field productionpeaked at 180,000 bopd in 1982, out of which 128,000 bopdwere being produced, thanks to water injection fig.",maintain/increase production
"spe 110882 5 in 2005, 26 light work overs have done in which 19 or 75 are successful.",positive result
"the initialproject was limited to the five most promising, mostly for reasonsrelated to the availability of injection gas.in light of the results obtained so far and of the improved under-standing and knowledge gained during the first 3 years, it wasdecided to extend the current project to a second phase.",positive result
the mobility of the gas results in early breakthrough in the closer wells with their consequent shut-in and loss of production.,low production
"from then on, the heavy oil production increased.",maintain/increase production
"46 gas fingering is also reduced during cwi because co2 is present in a dissolved state, which leads to a better sweep efficiency as compared with co2 flooding.47 based on visualization and core flooding experiments at real reservoir conditions, sohrabi et al.39 revealed another important mechanism of cwi, evolution of a new gaseous phase, triggered page 4 of 44acs paragon plus environmentenergy fuels123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930313233343536373839404142434445464748495051525354555657585960",high recovery
therefore been achieved corresponding to an incremental oil recovery of 2.3 .,high recovery
"2 otc 22560 numerical model runs, which were calibrated to early production history, predicted severe production decline without a pressure maintenance program. therefore, waterflooding was proposed following the development drilling program, to quickly restore production capacity and provide effective sweep in the c 3.",low production
it can be inferred that the decline in reservoir pressure is greater than expected.,pressure depletion

High-pressured air injection has been keeping reservoir pressure above 4000 psi.,maintain pressure
"the experiments show promising result, showing the cost-effective program for field management.",positive result
"the south-west compartment shows very high 70% remaining oil saturation, the highest throughout the field.",poor recovery
