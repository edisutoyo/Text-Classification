"the influence of fluid viscosity, interfacial tension, and flow velocity on residual oil saturation left by waterflood abstri ct a.abrams member spe-aime results of short-core flow tests are presented for six different sandstones and one limestone to show the influence of interfacial tension, fluid viscosity, and flow velocity on waterflood sor' to make certain that oil trapping occurred in the presence of the test flood water, the floods were initiated saturations at which the oil phase was continuous and in contact with the test flood water as the connate water.",Waterflooding

waterfloods with normal water usually leave from one-third to one-half the oil initially present in a reservoir as immobile globules distributea through the pores of the rock.,Waterflooding
this leads to a reduction of the residual oil saturation left by the waterflood.,Waterflooding
"the term normal water indicates a water solution whose pertinent physical and chemical properties are essentially the same as waters involved in waterflooding oil reservoirs, that is, ao w 2 25 dynes em andl1w ,'o.oi poise.",Waterflooding

"in this paper, we are examining the behavior of the enhanced waterflood stage of the process.",Waterflooding
"at the initiation of the waterflood the water is injected into the sample essentially as a sharp front, and the diffused zone created by imbibition that leads to oil trapping develops as the front moves into the rock.",Waterflooding
 other difficulties arise as the water approaches the outflow end of the sample during the waterflood.,Waterflooding
"each short-core flood involved the following sequence of operations, starting with a core containing a known sot from a previous waterflood.",Waterflooding
"such floods were done from four to 12 times in sequence, volumetric measurements were used to determine 5 wt at the start of each test waterflood and sot at the end.",Waterflooding
"as would be expected, the residual water banked up behinci the oil and the 5 at measured was found to be the same as that which would be obtaineci with a 0.0094 -poi se waterflood.",Waterflooding
another significant observation for the enhanced waterfloods is that oil recovery is essentially complete at water through.,Waterflooding
a third pertinent observation is that 50t established by a normal waterflood could not be reduced significantly by a subsequent 100-to 500-fold increase in the rate of injection of the flood water.,Waterflooding
"once trapping occurs in a normal waterflood, it has been estimated 3 that the oil is held by capillary forces of such a magnitude that interfacial tension reduction to values of the order of 10-3 to 10-4 dyne em is required to remove significant quantities of oil under the flow conditions obtainable in the reservoir.",Waterflooding
"5 , we see that variation of f in the range 10-5 does not produce a significant change in 50t' the maximum value of f likely to be reached in the normal waterflooding of a water-wet reservoir is 1.4 x 10-6 v 10 ft d or 3.5 x 10-3 cm sec, 11 w - ,.",Waterflooding
"thus, increases in injection rate for the usual waterflood cannot significantly reduce 50t for the water-swept zone.",Waterflooding
for a significant reduction in 50t' the value of f must be about 100-fold greater than that obtained under highly favorable conditions in a normal waterflood.,Waterflooding

ot this represents a 16-saturation-percent reduction in 50t from the 28 percent left by the normal waterflood.,Waterflooding
"to test the behavior of the process at oil saturations applicable in the field, it is necessary to study the enhanced waterflood at initial oil saturations that would be found in an oil bank generated in some recovery process that leads to reconnection of trapped oil.",Waterflooding
"conclusions significant reductions in residual oil saturations after a waterflood can be achieveci through the use of enhanced flood water, that is, water containing chemicals that increase the water viscosity and decrease the water-oil interfacial tension under saturation conditions, so that the oil is in a continuous or connected state as the enhanced flood water displaces the oil from the rock.",Waterflooding
"these variables, as well as flow velocity, can influence the behavior of a waterflood by altering the tiveness of the capillary trapping forces at the flood front.",Waterflooding

two adiabatic diskreactor experiments were performed with handil oil androck samples.,Experiments
the comparison between theoretical andmeasured heat rates proved that adiabatic conditions were wellrespected in the experiments as shown in figure 7.,Experiments

"however, thislaboratory constraint does not mean that a self-ignition of theoxidation reactions is not expected in the handil field.further experiments with other oils will have to be performedand compared with these disk reactor experiments.once the oxidation reactions were adiabatically tracked,the handil reservoir oil showed a good reactivity with atemperature increase from t 134 c to t 400 c in 5 hours.the temperature limitation at 400 c is inherent to a lack offuel in the core.the heat rate profile, giving the exothermic characteristicsof handil oil, is shown in logarithmic scale in figure 9.",Experiments

this can be explained by the fact that more air isrequired in the crushed core experiments to burn the oil inplace.,Experiments
"indeed, the higher porosity levels obtained with crushedcore experiments result in larger quantities of oil being burnedper volume of reservoir rock.",Experiments
"that is why nelson and mcniel8proposed a correction of the air requirement measured in acrushed core experiment by the real porosity.the fuel load calculated with handil oil remains in atypical range of values measured during combustion tubeexperiments.finally, the co2 co ratio with handil oil is relativelyhigh, showing that a complete combustion occurred during therun.conclusionsa new and original laboratory strategy was proposed to assessthe recovery potential by air injection and to help determineoptimal operating conditions required for a safe and successfulair injection project.",Experiments

abstract co2 injection has been used in the oil industry as an effective technique for enhanced recovery of light to medium oils.,CO2 injection
co2 injection for the geological storage in heavy oil reservoirs can also reduce its emissions and contribute towards development of clean fossil fuel production and climate change mitigation.,CO2 injection
"it was found that depending on co2 injection pressure, different injection schemes can lead to variant accumulative heavy oil productions and co2 storage capacities.",CO2 injection
"in addition, it was observed that increase in the co2 injection pressure enhances the heavy oil recovery and subsequently causes more co2 to be stored.",CO2 injection
"the performance of a co2 flooding process is strongly dependent on the oil viscosity reduction, oil swelling effect, and interfacial property changes between the crude oil and co211,12,13.",CO2 injection
"in general, co2 flooding can be classified as miscible or immiscible processes",CO2 injection
"many researchers have explained that immiscible co2 flooding is an important, field-proven heavy oil recovery method, particularly suited for thin marginal, or otherwise poor heavy oil reservoirs.",CO2 injection
"immiscible co2 flooding in heavy oil reservoirs can result in decreasing the ift, reducing the heavy oil viscosity, and swelling of the oil16.",CO2 injection
the extent of these effects is less pronounced in comparison with miscible co2 flooding in light to medium oil reservoirs.,CO2 injection
the main problem associated with co2 eor in heavy oil reservoirs is due to the extremely high mobility of co2 in comparison with that of the original heavy oil.,CO2 injection
"nevertheless, higher co2 injection pressure enhances the co2 swelling effect and thus increases the microscopic sweep efficiency.",CO2 injection
"as a result at a higher co2 injection pressure, the accumulative heavy oil production in the injection of a pure co2 slug is higher than that in the other two injection schemes.",CO2 injection
"it was also observed that in the runs where a pure co2 slug was injected into the model, the accumulative heavy oil production increased more quickly at the beginning of co2 injection in comparison with the runs where carbonated water was injected into the model.",CO2 injection
"in addition, comparison of the amount of co2 stored inside the model shows that at a lower co2 injection pressure, injection of a pure co2 slug resulted in a higher mass of co2 to be stored inside the simulation model in comparison with that in injection of carbonated water slug, as presented in table 2 and figure 5 a .",CO2 injection

"however, higher co2 injection pressure resulted in a higher accumulative heavy oil production.",CO2 injection
"as it can be seen from these figures, an increase in the co2 injection pressure leads to a corresponding increase in the amount of co2 stored inside the simulation model.",CO2 injection
"it was observed that in the run where a pure co2 slug was injected into the model, the amount of co2 stored inside the model increased sharply at the beginning of co2 injection before co2 breakthrough and started to decline after co2 breakthrough until it reached an almost stabilized value.",CO2 injection
"at lower co2 injection pressure, the initial sharp increase in the amount of co2 stored is less pronounced.",CO2 injection
it was observed that a larger co2 slug size can enhance the oil production only at the beginning of co2 injection.,CO2 injection

many of these wells were completed with permanent bottom-hole gauges for monitoring of flowing pressure data.,others
the choice of the artificial lift method was governed primarily by the ability to handle sand production.,others
the old vertical wells which were gravel packed were mostly completed with rod-pumps.,others
the readings from the bottom-hole gauges are available on real time via supervisory control and data acquisition (scada) system.,others
monitoring of data from these gauges has helped in optimization of production from the reservoir.,others

presence and concentration of tracers in produced water from nearby producers or other producers that could be influenced,others
iptc 10330  5 by injection were measured.,others
the arrival times and concentrations of tracers at different producers revealed a lot of information about fluid flow paths in the reservoir.,others
"in the case of first injector (inj-c), practically the entire tracer was detected in another horizontal well (prod-g) within a very short period of time.",others
rapid arrival of tracer at very high concentration showed very strong hydrodynamic communication between the injector and the producer through an abnormally high conductive path (fracture).,others
extensive data acquisition programme during this phase to reduce uncertainty in the next phase of development is discussed.,others
introduction the field under discussion is located on the eastern flank of south oman salt basin (fig.1).,others
the field comprises a ne-sw trending anticline about 14 km long and 8 km wide.,others
"to date, more than 400 wells have been drilled in the field encountering oil producing reservoirs in the mahwis formation (the haima group of cambro-ordivician age) and the al khlata and gharif formations (haushi group of carboniferous/permian age) at depth ranges of 550-675 m sub-sea (ss).",others
the screens used 8-1/4fl centralizers to remove dls issues and the lower completion was successfully run to the designed depth.,others
"due to the well confirming drawndown c_4, the optimal injection scenario was confirmed such that the younger c_3 unit could be blanked.",others
i_1 open-hole section needed 784m of blank pipe and 320m of screens.,others
a large inventory of equipment had been maintained due to such uncertainties coupled with the long lead-time needed to manufacture and ship new equipment.,others
"as such, these real-time completion design changes did not pose logistical issues, however the completion interval required a combination of 5-1/2fl blank pipe as well as 6-5/8fl blank pipe that was typically used for carbonate reservoir wells.",others
a good formation cleanup was critical to achieve the target injection rate.,others
the difference for an injector completion is that the well would not be produced prior to injection start-up.,others
the reservoir drilling fluid incorporated an internal breaker that could be activated by an external breaker as a cleanup measure.,others
all other aspects of the completion design remained the same as for the producers.,others
"the internal breaker is activated by a ph change and if it were to change during drilling, fluid losses would be observed.",others
the ph remained stable during drilling.,others
"once the external breaker was spotted, the internal breaker activated simultaneously.",others
indications of the breaker working are: observed fluid losses when tagging for upper completion space-out and when finally landing the upper completion.,others
in both instances the fluid loss valve was opened and immediate losses were observed at these points during i_1 completion.,others
"due to the relatively low fracture gradient (about 0.70 psi/ft) found in the original producer, there were concerns about the low circulating rates required to remain below fracture gradient and the ability to gravel pack the well.",others
"a range of fracture gradients and circulating rates were considered in the design models suggesting that the gravel pack would have to be pumped at a lower rate than usual, starting at about 5 bpm as opposed to the usual 7-8 bpm for css producers.",others
"for this reason, the centralizers were considered to be removed in order to increase the likelihood of already covering the screens during the alpha wave.",others
the caliper data showed that i_1 wellbore was very gauge with a few points showing an id of 9.25-9.50fl providing more confidence on the completion job success.,others
circulation tests suggested that circulating pressure was slightly less than anticipated and the pumping job actually started with 7 bpm.,others
"it was expected that 57,000 lbs of gravel would be needed and at the end of a successful conclusion, just over 64,000 lbs were placed below the packer.",others
start-up considerations and operational issues   an adequate voidage replacement required a high and sustained injectivity for i_1.,others
no emulsion or relative permeability related injectivity decline is expected as the injection interval is well below the owc.,others
"however, the team recognized the risk of injectivity loss due to improper seawater filtration and chemical treatment.",others
required filtration level was estimated to be 10 microns considering the pore throat size estimates for 1.3 d and 30 % porosity and scanning electron microscopy (sem) results (figure - 9 and figure - 10).,others
"in the end, a complex injection well (called i_1) was designed to penetrate both stratigraphic intervals to confirm pressure and sand communication.",others
"if the c_4 interval showed virgin reservoir pressure, the well plan was to have enough kh in the younger unit to support the needed injectivity.",others
"however, if c_4 was drawndown, the optimal plan was to blank the younger unit and extend the toe in the older unit to take advantage of baffled connections.",others
"the model outcome for the proposed plan indicated similar results to the i_0a location, but would save substantial cost and mitigate risks of extended reach drilling, costly pilot, and likely sidetracks searching for reservoir (which may be disconnected) when drilling far-removed from well control (uncertainty in velocity modeling beyond well control posed a significant risk in positioning i_0a).",others
the practical solution from a subsurface perspective was to perform the sidetrack but this operation presented significant drilling and completion challenges of its own.,others
well planning  the drilling design of the injector had the primary objective of hitting and evaluating all targets in c_3 and c_4 sands.,others
"the opportunity to sidetrack out of the 9-5/8fl casing from an idle wellbore offered a chance for significant reduction in total well cost, but added significant design and operational challenges.",others
"to optimally intersect all desired targets, the wellbore had to be designed to exit out of the casing (figure  6) at an angle of 81 inclination.",others
the specific challenges with the plan exiting from the 9-5/8fl casing included:  drilling a 1100 m 8-1/2fl section with water based drilling fluid at a near horizontal hole angle with high friction factors (the longest 8-1/2fl hole section to be attempted by the team)  limitations on the drilling rig capabilities in terms of torque and pump pressure capacities  designing a complex three-dimensional wellbore to intersect and evaluate all targets (pressures and kh) while maintaining wellbore integrity  setting and using a whipstock deep in the wellbore at near-horizontal section and exiting from casing with mills.,others
4  otc 22560  drilling with a complex bottom hole assembly package where potential high shocks and vibrations could create tool failures.,others
the team called upon extensive lessons in torque and drag modeling from other wellbores drilled from the platform.,others
"these lessons provided empirical changes to the models and assisted in optimizing the drill string design, whipstock placement, and improving drilling practice to reach the target depth.",others
"total available torque of the rig package was limited to 35k ft-lbs, emphasizing the importance of accurate torque modeling to ensure reaching the target depth.",others
a friction factor of 0.25 was assumed in the well model based on previous experience in drilling out of 9-5/8fl casing with a water based drill-in-fluid.,others
the model suggested a minimum of 1500m of smaller od drillpipe required at the bottom of the drill string in order to reduce total torque.,others
a mixed drill string of 5-1/2fl 24.7 s-135 with 1740m of 5fl 19.5ppf s-135 at the bottom of the string was designed and re-evaluated in the model.,others
"the results showed that the planned total measured depth of 5950m at a final inclination of 88 would approach the rigs mechanical limitations, but still enjoyed a high chance of success based on experience.",others
broad collaboration of the subsurface and drilling engineering team was required for optimal choice of casing exit point and wellbore trajectory.,others
"numerous iterations of the wellbore design were run in order to intersect geological targets, while also minimizing tortuosity of the wellbore to remain within torque limitations of drilling rig capabilities.",others
"in addition to modifications of the wellbore trajectory, other options for drilling fluids and additives were examined in order to reduce torque and ensure objectives would be reached.",others

acknowledgment the authors wish to thank arco alaska inc. and arco exploration and production technology for their permission to publish this paper.,others
"the reason for this is that fe++ has reached a saturation point, subsequently, excess fe++ begins to precipitate.",others
"because of the reverse solubility of the carbonate with respect to temperature, dissolved prudhoe siderite around the injector at 80 deg f causes fec03 to re-precipitate as seawater is heated up to the reservoir temperature of 195 deg f. also, the ph is higher in high temperature areas (because of the reduced solubility of c02 with increasing temperature) and this makes fec03 less soluble.",others
re-precipitation accelerates as pressure decreases (or ph rises) around the producer.,others
"the highest fe++ concentration in the effluent is about 60 ppm, and the highest fe++ concentration in the reservoir is about 200 ppm in low temperature areas around the injector.",others
these two numbers assume no h2s in the system.,others
"if h2s is present, part of the dissolved iron will precipitate as iron sulfide.",others
7) calcium (ca++): figure 16 gives field measurements of ca ++ in effluent.,others
the prediction in figure 17 is not totally consistent with the field observation.,others
"according to the field data, some ca ++ disappears in the early stage or up to 30 percent of seawater in produced water, then follows the mixing line beyond that point.",others
"the prediction has a similar trend at the beginning, but dissolution becomes excessive afterwards and causes excess ca++ in solution (or above the mixing line).",others
"according to figure 18, cac03 precipitated around the producer at the initial production stage (up to 20-30 percent seawater in produced water), this causes the disappearance of ca ++at the beginning.",others
"afterwards, cac03 re-dissolves as more seawater breaks through and the ph declines.",others
cac03 completely dissolves at 60 percent seawater breakthrough.,others
"the calcite problem was observed in the field during the early production stage at prudhoe, as also indicated by the simulation results in figure 1813,14.",others
8) magnesium (mg++): the simulation indicates that some magnesium ions are being adsorbed onto reservoir rock through ion exchange and this causes a decrease of the dissolved magnesium ion in the aqueous phase (figure 20).,others
it is believed that boron is nonreactive under reservoir conditions.,others
"in the model, a nonreactive species was also created for the purpose of conducting field data history matching.",others
"by changing the peclet number (bulk mass transfer i diffusive mass transfer) in the mass transfer equation, the degree of mixing between the formation water and seawater by dispersion was created.",others
results and interpretations the following summarizes simulation predictions versus field observations: 1) 12-h: the reservoir acidity increases (or ph decreases) as reservoir fluids are displaced by seawater.,others
"figure 4 presents the measured ph values of prudhoe produced water samples at surface conditions, and figure 5 is the calculated ph values at downhole conditions.",others
"on average, the downhole calculated ph's are about one ph unit below the surface measured ph's because c02 in the field samples was released by depressurization at the surface.",others
"however, both curves show a similar trend.",others
"at 60 percent seawater breakthrough, one carbonate phase completely dissolves (this will be discussed later), and the ph in the aqueous phase is no longer buffered by the carbonate.",others
there is a steep decline of ph afterwards.,others
"2) bicarbonate (hc03-l: both field data and simulation, illustrated in figures 6 and 7, show excess hc03-above the mixing line.",others
the best explanation for the increase of hc03-is that dissolved divalent ions are replaced by monovalent ions through the ion exchange mechanism.,others
"when the lower ph seawater invades the reservoir and dissolves additional carbonates, either siderite or calcite, the liberated 619 divalent cations from dissolved carbonates exchange with the monovalent cations in clays.",others
this causes excess co3--in the aqueous phase and subsequently results in more hc03-in the solution.,others
"at levels above 60 percent seawater breakthrough, one carbonate phase, calcium carbonate, has completely dissolved.",others
"thus, there is less c03 --in the aqueous phase and, consequently, excess hc03-gradually disappears as well, as illustrated in both figures.",others
3) sulfate (so.f-): field samples in figure 8 show that sulfate is missing in the reservoir.,others
"4  spe 92858  the study confirmed the efficacy of the processes, where very low residual oil saturations are achieved around the first row producers and remaining mobile oil areas have been swept by the gas.",others

this average saturation is usually higher than connate water and the difference with connate water increases for samples which were not effectively cleaned.,others
therefore the spread in the starting points (at zero pc) does not reflect a spread in connate water saturations.,others
the imbibition pc curves in general follow,others
6  iptc 11722 the same classification scheme as for the drainage pc curves.,others
"group a has low entry pressure and starts to increase smoothly, the residual oil saturation varies between 5-15%.",others
group b has also low entry pressure (though higher than group a) and then the pc increases faster as the water saturation increases.,others
the residual oil saturation varies between 8%-16%.,others
"group c has a high entry pressure (2-4 psi), and the residual oil saturation varies between 5-18%.",others
"similar to connate water, there is in general a trend of increasing residual oil saturation as porosity decreases within each group.",others
"however, there is no correlation of sor with porosity across the groups.",others
no spontaneous imbibition of water was observed on all the samples following aging with crude oil and connate water at reservoir temperature.,others
as discussed in the previous section some of the plugs were cleaned by method (1) and as a result the water-oil primary drainage pc curves were affected.,others
"since the plugs did not start from strongly water-wet conditions during primary drainage (see previous section), it raised a question concerning the effect of this ineffective cleaning on the imbibition pc curves.",others
could the wetting state after aging be significantly affected thus resulting in a more oil-wet rock?,others
we know from experience that aging the sample for longer time (longer than 4-6 weeks) does not result in a stronger oil-wet system for carbonate reservoirs.,others
"therefore, starting at a weakly water-wet condition may not result in a more strongly oil-wet system if no external factors are involved other than the adsorption of organic matter from the crude.",others
"to verify the impact of ineffective cleaning on imbibition pc curves, we have studied the imbibition pc curves to see if any correlation between the negative pc curves and the inefficient cleaning could be found.",others
"no such correlation was found, as higher contact angle during primary drainage did not correlate with higher contact angle during imbibition.",others
"in addition, imbibition capillary pressure curves were repeated on the samples that had gone through the further cleaning method (2).",others
figure 11 shows the imbibition pc after the cleaning methods (1) and (2).,others
the data show no difference between the two sets of imbibition pc curves (one following the ineffective cleaning method 1 and the other following the thorough cleaning procedure 2).,others
figure 12 shows the imbibition capillary pressure curves measured on 31 samples.,others
"similar to drainage, the data are measured on samples from different permeability and porosity classes and different rock textures.",others
mercury-air derived drainage pc curves should be used for the primary drainage process to establish the initial sw distributions as ineffective cleaning of core samples does not appear to affect the mercury-air drainage pc curves.,others
"since cleaning was found to be the reason for the mismatch between the water-oil and mercury injection data, another cleaning method was investigated which is referred to as cleaning method (2) (hot soxhlett extraction followed by flow-through cleaning): the plugs were first cleaned using the above cleaning method (1) and then mounted in a hassler core holder at a confining pressure of 30 bars.",others
the plugs were alternately flooded with 100% chloroform at a back pressure of 5 bars.,others
after flooding with about three pore volumes of chloroform the core was left to soak overnight.,others
the procedure was repeated again with the next chloroform flood.,others
in total more than 15 pore volumes of chloroform were used until the effluent became colourless.,others
"to further improve the effectiveness of cleaning, our current procedure for this reservoir rock/fluid system is to use flow-through cleaning method (2) mentioned above by alternating with different solvents (chloroform, thf, methanol).",others
the efficiency of the new cleaning method has been investigated.,others
three samples that showed the most difference between water-oil and mercury injection converted data were selected to go through cleaning method (2) and the water-oil drainage pc curve was measured using the centrifuge.,others
figure 9 compares the new water-oil pc curve measured on one of the samples with the mercury injection data.,others
the figure shows an excellent match demonstrating that the new cleaning method is sufficient to achieve uniformly water-wet samples.,others
the centrifuge technique has also been used to measure the water-air pc curves on a set of samples.,others
the objective of this part is to confirm whether cleaning was the reason for the discrepancy between the water-oil and hg-air data.,others
the water-air data does not suffer from cleaning problems as air is the clear non-wetting phase.,others
figure 10 shows a comparison of hg-air and centrifuge water-air pc curves indicating a close match.,others
"8 and 9, we can see that a relatively small change in kv/kh does not have any significant effect on the models performance.",others
however a change up to one hundred folds may have significant impact on the performance as indicated by the lines representing the performance of such reservoirs with kv/kh being 0.001.,others
it is shown that a change of kv/kh from 0.1 to 0.001 has greater impact on the performance of a reservoir with increasing upward permeability trend.,others
"when compared to the performance in which kv/kh equals 0.1, for a system with",others
"6  spe 87016 decreasing upward permeability trend, a change of kv/kh to 0.001 may decrease the oil recovery up to around 2% whereas for a system with increasing upward permeability trend the same change in kv/kh may decrease the oil recovery up to more than 10%.",others
"in general, a decrease in crossflow magnitude would result in worse vertical sweep efficiency.",others
"however, in most actual reservoirs the value of kv/kh usually falls not very far from 0.1.",others
"as mentioned before, it is very likely to find a reservoir in which the permeability does not exhibit an absolutely decreasing or increasing upward trend.",others
"there may be several layers among all the layers constructing the reservoir that do not necessarily exhibit an absolute trend, but still considered to generally follow either one of the two trends.",others
"6 noted earlier, the oil recovery for systems with crossflow (both with increasing and decreasing upward permeability trends) are always intermediate between that predicted for a uniform system and that for a stratified reservoir with no crossflow.",others
"as stated in the previous section, maximum crossflow due to viscous forces occurs at the vicinity of the front in the more permeable layer.",others
"however, according to zapata and lake, viscous crossflow does not only take place at the leading front in the more permeable layer, but also at the trailing front in the less permeable layer.",others
"8 for a displacement with mobility ratio of the interacting fluids being less than unity (m < 1), the direction of viscous crossflow is from the less to the more permeable layer at the leading front and from the more to the less permeable layer at the trailing front as illustrated by fig.",others
"in our case, mobility ratio is less than unity and water is displacing oil, therefore oil flows from the less to the more permeable layer at the leading front and water flows counter-currently at the trailing front from the more to the less permeable layer.",others
"since the number of layer is more than two, a relatively similar mechanism is considered to occur repeatedly in the adjacent layers throughout the reservoir.",others
these should result in receding and advancing of the fronts within the more and the less permeable layers resulting in a better performance of a stratified reservoir with crossflow compared to those with no-crossflow.,others
"in other words, the existence of crossflow enhances the vertical sweep efficiency of the displacement in stratified reservoirs.",others
"when the more permeable layers are on the upper part of the reservoir, crossflow due to gravity forces favors the flow of water to drain toward the less permeable layers on the lower part of the reservoir.",others
"thus, vertical sweep efficiency is even better than that when only viscous crossflow occurs due to the favorable effect of gravity forces.",others
"on the other hand, when the more permeable layers are on the lower part of the reservoir, since viscous crossflow still moves toward the same direction (oil flows from the less to the more permeable layers at the leading front and water flows counter-currently at the trailing front) and gravity forces still forces water to drain into the lower part of the reservoir, the effect of gravity crossflow is no longer favorable.",others
this phenomenon had also been observed by berruin and morse12 when conducting their investigation.,others
"as mentioned, it is quite impossible for a certain formation to have neither an absolutely fining upward nor coarsening upward grain size sequence.",others
"normally, there will be some layers that exhibit less fine or less coarse grain size contrary to their distribution, but still can be generally considered as to have a fining upward grain size sequence or coarsening upward grain size sequence.",others
"in this study, the term noise is used to indicate such phenomenon.",others
therefore verification of the results is done by allowing the models to have certain layers in which the permeability values does not solely exhibit a decreasing upward or increasing upward trend.,others
a computer program is used to generate a certain range of random numbers that are assigned to the models as multiplying factors of the permeability values.,others
a check should be made on their coefficient of variation to avoid the models from having different levels of permeability variation.,others
"in this specific case, verification is performed on systems with vdp = 0.8.",others
"as many as five additional models were run, in which each model represents the effect of realization due to actual field condition.",others
10 through 14 shows the effects of realization in which each figure represents different type of noise.,others
"from these charts, it is clear that realization does not change the trend of the performance of such stratified reservoirs due to permeability trend (grain size distribution).",others
